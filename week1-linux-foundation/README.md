# Week 1: Linux Foundation - Project Setup Automation

## Description
This simple Bash script (`setup_project.sh`) automates the creation of a standard directory structure (`td`, `la`, `at`) for new software projects.

## Skills Demonstrated
- **Basic Linux CLI:** `mkdir`, `echo`, `ls`, `chmod`.
- **Bash Scripting:** Creating and executing a `.sh` file with the correct shebang (`#!/bin/bash`).
- **Automation Mindset:** Identifying a repetitive task and automating it to save time and ensure consistency.

## Business Value
This script, while simple, represents a foundational step in DevOps. In an enterprise environment, this principle is scaled up to automate server provisioning and application deployments, leading to:
- **Increased Efficiency:** Reduces manual, error-prone setup time.
- **Standardization:** Ensures every project starts with a consistent, approved structure.
